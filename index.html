				<p class="text-justify">Our landlords have been doing background checks on you all the time. Why not we turn the table now and check their reviews? Here, on this very site you are in now, is the goldmine of reviews on whether you should sign your names on that lease agreements. Think of it as RateMyProfessors but instead of reading reviews of those pesky (just kidding!) professors, you would be reading reviews of your potential landlords</p>

				<p class="text-justify">    This site will help you to separate the marketing front from the reality, and you are on your way to be better informed on where you should live for the next one year (or more!). This is a decision that can impact your quality of life. So, make sure you have done your research!</p>
